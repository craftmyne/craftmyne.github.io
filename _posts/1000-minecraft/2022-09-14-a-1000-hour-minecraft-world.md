2020 Was a peculiar year, we we're all tucked into our homes and suddenly lost a lot of the daily routines we were so used to. 
Many of us started getting into hobbies, working out, we had a lot more spare time than we did before. 
In hindsight I should have probably gotten into a hobby of some sort, but my undying love for gaming led me to starting a minecraft youtube letsplay series.

#### The first episode:

So at four in the morning on a school night, I hit the record button on OBS and created a new world. I've made this post on my world because over the past two years it has brought me so much joy. I have never commit to a singular project as I have with this world, and to look at the progress I've made, even though its just a videogame, it feels a lot more rewarding than some rank in CSGO or Apex. 

Plus I think I've accumulated some pretty cool builds in my world, here's my main spawn area:

One of the first large builds I ever attempted was a slime farm, Using a seedloader I was able to locate 4 slime chunks fairly close to my spawn area and began to dig. Once it was done I wasn't too happy with how it looked just being a massive hole in the middle of nowhere, so I built a castle casing around it, and added a little safehouse I could sit in to allow the slimes to spawn. I think it all looks really good even from the sky:

    </div>

It actually took me a long time to get to the end, but when I did I believe I quickly made a portal build, instead of some beautiful hall, or a intricate silverfish farm. I thought it would be fun to jump down a massive hole into the portal. So thats what I did, in the middle of the desert, I dug out a very nice crevase in the sand.
