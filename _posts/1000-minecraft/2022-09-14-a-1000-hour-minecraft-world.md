2020 Was a peculiar year, we we're all tucked into our homes and suddenly lost a lot of the daily routines we were so used to. 
Many of us started getting into hobbies, working out, we had a lot more spare time than we did before. 
In hindsight I should have probably gotten into a hobby of some sort, but my undying love for gaming led me to starting a minecraft youtube letsplay series.

#### The first episode:

So at four in the morning on a school night, I hit the record button on OBS and created a new world. I've made this post on my world because over the past two years it has brought me so much joy. I have never commit to a singular project as I have with this world, and to look at the progress I've made, even though its just a videogame, it feels a lot more rewarding than some rank in CSGO or Apex. 

Plus I think I've accumulated some pretty cool builds in my world, here's my main spawn area:
