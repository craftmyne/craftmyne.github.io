2020 Was a peculiar year, we we're all tucked into our homes and suddenly lost a lot of the daily routines we were so used to. 
Many of us started getting into hobbies, working out, we had a lot more spare time than we did before. 
In hindsight I should have probably gotten into a hobby of some sort, but my undying love for gaming led me to starting a minecraft youtube letsplay series.

#### The first episode:

So at four in the morning on a school night, I hit the record button on OBS and created a new world. I've made this post on my world because over the past two years it has brought me so much joy. I have never commit to a singular project as I have with this world, and to look at the progress I've made, even though its just a videogame, it feels a lot more rewarding than some rank in CSGO or Apex. 

Plus I think I've accumulated some pretty cool builds in my world, here's my main spawn area:

One of the first large builds I ever attempted was a slime farm, Using a [seedloader](https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map) I was able to locate 4 slime chunks fairly close to my spawn area and began to dig. Once it was done I wasn't too happy with how it looked just being a massive hole in the middle of nowhere, so I built a castle casing around it, and added a little safehouse I could sit in to allow the slimes to spawn. However in retrospect due to spawning spheres, its probably best to build a platform maybe around 50 blocks above the farm so that all of the platforms are a sufficient distance away to allow for spawning. If you're confused on what I mean by spawning sphere's the minecraft wiki has a page on [spawning mechanics](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Spawn#Spawn_conditions). Here's the finished slime farm area:

It actually took me a long time to get to the end, but when I did I believe I quickly made a portal build, instead of some beautiful hall, or a intricate silverfish farm. I thought it would be fun to jump down a massive hole into the portal. So thats what I did, in the middle of the desert, I dug out a very nice crevase in the sand. I think in future I may create nether roads that lead to a different stronghold so I can create a silverfish farm. But since there isn't a use for silverfish other than a small amount of XP, this project has no priority and may not be started for a long time.

A lot of the hours spent on this world we're spent doing mindless tasks like mining. It's fun and I can usually put on a movie, podcast or music while I play because of how little focus is required, a place I spent a fair amount of time at was the MESA mine. It's pretty self explanatory, it resides within a Mesa biome, and I spend my time there mining terracotta, a nice block which I enjoy building with as it's a flat color block. The more I show off in this article the more I realise I probably need a name for this stuff, Mesa Mine doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.
