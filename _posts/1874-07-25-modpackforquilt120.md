### Disclaimer:
Mods marked with ðŸ¦• might be flagged as cheating by servers.

A majority of these mods might be considered as cheating/hacking on hypixel/whatever else, they aid vanilla gameplay, but in competitive scenarios have the ability to give a massive advantage. 
Joining a server like hypixel with these mods is not recommended, please be careful.

But also don't be scared if you accidentally join one, just make sure not to actively play with them.

### Body content

Hello! I have decided to put together the mods I use on vanilla survival servers. These are all client-side, meaning that like optifine, you may use them independtly from the server.

I will have two versions of this pack, one with performance mods, and one with performance mods + utility mods.

### How install pls?

I


### FAQ

#### I already use optifine why should I use this?

You don't need to! if you're happy with your performance now and don't want anything more, there is no need. However, if you'd like an improvement in performance across the board, I recommend using the provided pack.

#### Are there any system requirements? 

If you can already run minecraft then this work perfectly!


#### I'm on windows 7, will this work?

I have no idea.
