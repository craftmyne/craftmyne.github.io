Hello! This is a post about a server I'm launching which will be running a fabric based modpack! I thought I'd make it extra quirky and go for a fancy name, so I used french! Those snail eating revolutionaries really know a thing or two about nice words sadly.
This is a semi-public server, I setup the server for my friends & I.

Anyways, if you believe that you can act like an adult and play well with us, shoot me a message on discord: Sean#0650 
Please don't feel scared to! you can join a million times and never say Hi and you'll still be a valued member.

You can look at the [client](/nouveauclient) side mods here and the [server](/nouveauserver) side mods here. 

If you'd like to download the pack to install it you can do so [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eAGF4BoQTLcpBi66ZUt09uipI89iKT0y/view?usp=sharing) this pack is in a curseforge format, so you may import it using curseforge, or any compatible launcher.

the IP is: 'ijustgotla.id' my excuse is thats the only domain I had free for use.

<div class="iframe-container">
  <iframe id="dynamic-iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

<script>
  var iframe = document.getElementById('dynamic-iframe');
  iframe.src = 'http://ijustgotla.id:8123';

  // Optional: Adjust iframe size dynamically
  function resizeIframe() {
    iframe.style.height = iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px';
  }

  // Call resizeIframe whenever the content in the iframe changes
  iframe.addEventListener('load', resizeIframe);
</script>
