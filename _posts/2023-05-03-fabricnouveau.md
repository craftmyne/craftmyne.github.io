Hello! This is a post about a server I'm launching which will be running a fabric based modpack! I thought I'd make it extra quirky and go for a fancy name, so I used french! Those snail eating revolutionaries really know a thing or two about nice words sadly.
This is a semi-public server, I setup the server for my friends & I.

Anyways, if you believe that you can act like an adult and play well with us, shoot me a message on discord: Sean#0650 
Please don't feel scared to! you can join a million times and never say Hi and you'll still be a valued member.

You can look at the [client](/nouveauclient) side mods here and the [server](/nouveauserver) side mods here. 

If you'd like to download the pack to install it you can do so by following these simple steps:
- Download the pack as a zip from [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjygWOcT5btHh_xMPJKhvYT0VCiJUg) 
- Then go to any compatible launcher and import it as a zip. Curseforge, ATLauncher, PolyMC are all compatible

The IP is: 'ijustgotla.id' my excuse is thats the only domain I had free for use. 
And if you want to check the server map go to [map.ijustgotla.id](http://map.ijustgotla.id/)
