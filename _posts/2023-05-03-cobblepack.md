Hello! This is a post about a server I'm launching which will be running a [cobblemon](https://cobblemon.com/) based modpack!
This is a semi-public server, I setup the server for my friends & I.

However if you believe that you can act like an adult and play well with us, shoot me a message on discord: Sean#0650

You can look at the [client](/cobbleclient) side mods here and the [server](/cobbleserver) side mods here. 

If you'd like to download the pack to install it you can do so [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b7fu5QljH3vRmoRRsAPsa_rfQG_S9AzN/view?usp=share_link) this pack is in a curseforge format, so you may import it using curseforge, or any compatible launcher.

the IP is: ijustgotla.id
