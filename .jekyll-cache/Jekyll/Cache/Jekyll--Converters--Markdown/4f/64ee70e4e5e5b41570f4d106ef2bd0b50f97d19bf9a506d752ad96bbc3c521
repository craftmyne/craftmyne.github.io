I"<p>Hello! This is a post about a server I’m launching which will be running a fabric based modpack! I thought I’d make it extra quirky and go for a fancy name, so I used french! Those snail eating revolutionaries really know a thing or two about nice words sadly.
This is a semi-public server, I setup the server for my friends &amp; I.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you believe that you can act like an adult and play well with us, shoot me a message on discord: Sean#0650 
Please don’t feel scared to! you can join a million times and never say Hi and you’ll still be a valued member.</p>

<p>You can look at the <a href="/nouveauclient">client</a> side mods here and the <a href="/nouveauserver">server</a> side mods here.</p>

<p>If you’d like to download the pack to install it you can do so by following these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download the pack as a zip from <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjygWOcT5btHh_xMPJKhvYT0VCiJUg">here</a></li>
  <li>Then go to any compatible launcher and import it as a zip. Curseforge, ATLauncher, PolyMC are all compatible</li>
</ul>

<p>The IP is: ‘ijustgotla.id’ my excuse is thats the only domain I had free for use.
And if you want to check the server map go to <a href="http://map.ijustgotla.id/">map.ijustgotla.id</a></p>

<p>place</p>
