I"Y<p>Hello! This is a post about a server I’m launching which will be running a fabric based modpack! I thought I’d make it extra quirky and go for a fancy name, so I used french! Those snail eating revolutionaries really know a thing or two about nice words sadly.
This is a semi-public server, I setup the server for my friends &amp; I.</p>
