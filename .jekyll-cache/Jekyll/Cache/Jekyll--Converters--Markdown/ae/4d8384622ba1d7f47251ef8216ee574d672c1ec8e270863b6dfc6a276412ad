<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Mods marked with ðŸ¦• might be flagged as cheating by servers.
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>A majority of these mods might be considered as cheating/hacking on hypixel/whatever else, they aid vanilla gameplay, but in competitive scenarios have the ability to give a massive advantage. 
Joining a server like hypixel with these mods is not recommended, please be careful.</p>

<p>But also donâ€™t be scared if you accidentally join one, just make sure not to actively play with them.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h3>

<p>I have decided to put together the mods I use on vanilla survival servers. These are all client-side, meaning that like optifine, you may use them independtly from the server.</p>

<p>I will have two versions of this pack, one with performance mods and a few legal utility ones, and one with performance mods + illegal utility mods.</p>

<h3 id="how-install-pls">How install pls?</h3>

<p>There are two ways to install this pack, the recommended way is to use a modpack manager utility like curseforge, ATLauncher or any multiMC variant. However if youâ€™d like to use this on the base minecraft launcher I will provide a way for you to install this aswell, my tutorial will focus on installation on macOS, however this should be very similar to a installation on windows or linux.</p>

<p>If you can already run minecraft then this work perfectly!</p>

<h4 id="im-on-windows-7-will-this-work">Iâ€™m on windows 7, will this work?</h4>

<p>I have no idea.</p>

<h4 id="i-already-use-optifine-why-should-i-use-this">I already use optifine why should I use this?</h4>

<p>You donâ€™t need to! if youâ€™re happy with your performance now and donâ€™t want anything more, there is no need. However, if youâ€™d like an improvement in performance across the board, I recommend using the provided pack.</p>

<summary><a href="https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/" target="_blank">Here is an explanation from fabric as to why optifine sucks.</a></summary>
<br />
"OptiFine was originally a great mod offering many quality of life improvements for player in the beginning. However, over the years, its benefits have dwindled and has caused many issues for modders. This is due to Minecraft's codebase improving over the years and OptiFine's aggressiveness towards replacing entire swaths of code while being closed source making it very difficult to figure out why OptiFine has broken another modder's mod."

<h4 id="why-quilt-whats-wrong-with-fabric">Why quilt, whats wrong with fabric?</h4>

<p>Honestly? No idea, all I know is that the someone on the fabric team is transphobic and quilt is a fork of fabric that is more inclusive. A lot of developers I know have voiced their dislike for fabric and its practices.</p>

<br />

"I don't have any problem dissociating a project from the person behind it when that project is the best there is, however, Fabric's lead dev's transphobia genuinely got in the way of code contributions that would've been great additions to the loader's API (these contributions being made by trans people). Certain systems like the custom biome, dimension or multipart APIs of Fabric have a lot of problems and sometimes straight up don't work, while these issues have been fixed on Quilt."
