I am a Human who enjoys living on [Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/), Right now I am completing my Bachelors of Science in Artificial Intelligence at [JKU](https://www.jku.at/).

This blog will contain many of my hobbies, photos I think are cool, many of my minecraft builds, and progress on any ongoing projects!
